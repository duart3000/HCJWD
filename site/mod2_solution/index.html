					<h2>Lentil Burger</h2>
					<p>These scrumptious and filling patties have lentils, rice, walnuts and loads of flavor in them. Itâ€™s been a while since I made burger patties. I am hoping these fantastic burgers will be magical enough to get us some sunny days in the cloudy PNW. Am I ready for warmer days with loads of sunshine. The grey starts to depress even the chirpiest of the people and birds around.  </p>

					<h2>Chickpea Paratha</h2>
					<p>Stuffed Parathas used to be a favorite breakfast, lunch or evening snack when growing up. There was always some dough in the fridge, so it was matter of grating or mashing some veggies or other fillings, cooking them slightly if needed, and using as stuffing. Parathas are generally served with Indian pickles which commonly use raw mango, lime, chilies or vegetables preserved in an oil base with spices such as mustard seeds, fennel, fenugreek seeds,salt etc. These pickles are available in Indian stores or online. The stuffed flatbreads can also be used anywhere where you use flatbreads, as a side with curries or soups, or with a dip. </p>

					<h2>Carrot Cake</h2>
					<p>This carrot cake is loaded with shredded carrots and pureed carrots. All that carrot with the spices like cinnamon and cardamom (because Cardamom!), some ginger, and a creamy cream cheese style cashew vanilla frosting make this an irresistible loaf. The loaf is a carrot cake quick bread with mild sweetness. Add spices of choice, some nuts and dried fruit, bake, then frost with an easy cashew cream vanilla frosting. This is an incredibly moist carrot cake. It tastes even better after chilling as the spices infuse the loaf. The frosting is cashews plus little sweetener, lemon and vanilla! I use my mini food processor to shred the carrots. That reduces elbow grease and time needed. Bake this loaf and tag me on Instagram. What are your plans for Easter?</p>
